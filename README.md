# Todo List App

This is the first project of all the juniors in the programming.

I also wanted to make mine and give it my touch. It was made with React and Tailwind, I have little knowledge in both but I'm always learning more!

I want to share with you this, my first project to the public and if you look at it and have recommendations for best practices when writing code I would appreciate it.
